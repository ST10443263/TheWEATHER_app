The purpose of my app is to provide locals with the weekly weather. The app I have created is to give out weather results of the week or the average results of the week. This provision of real-time weather information , forecasts and other weather-related data, help people make better decisions about their day-to-day activities.
When entering my app , one will come across the splash screen of my app. Where the name of my app is visible “geometric weather”. Then you will see the logo of my app and two buttons where you can enter or exit the app.
In my app page 2 you will come across the days of the week. Using this the app should be able to calculate weekly temp as to what the whole weeks temperatures was
In my app on page 3 you will come across the days of the week so those who may not know how to spell may be able to copy from the writing .You are able to enter the day’s temp you specifically want and the results will appear below.
